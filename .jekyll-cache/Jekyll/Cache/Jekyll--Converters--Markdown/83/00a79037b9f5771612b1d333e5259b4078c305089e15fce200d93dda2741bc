<p>I’m a linguist from Denmark and a PhD candidate at the University of Newcastle in Australia. I currently research spatial language and cognition in Indigenous Australian languages as part of the <a href="https//www.ozspace.org">OzSpace project</a>. I completed my master’s degree at the University of Copenhagen in Functional and Cognitive Linguistics.</p>

<p>My primary research interests are within the fields of anthropological linguistics, cognitive science, and semantic typology.</p>
