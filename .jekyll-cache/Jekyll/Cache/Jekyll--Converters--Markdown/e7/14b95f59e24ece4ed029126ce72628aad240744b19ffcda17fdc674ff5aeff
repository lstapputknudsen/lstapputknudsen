<h2 id="anthropological-linguistics">Anthropological linguistics</h2>

<p>Understanding the complex interplay between the physical landscape, culture, cognition, and language is at the heart of my PhD, that is part of the ARC funded <a href="ozspace.org">OzSpace Project</a>, where I will be combining ethnographic methods with psycholinguistic experiments to explore spatial language, culture, and cognition in Indigenous Australia.</p>

<p>Apart from my fieldwork based PhD, Iâ€™ve been doing linguistic fieldwork since 2017. Iâ€™ve worked on documenting spatial language in Nahuatl as spoken in Tequila (Veracruz), Zojualo (San Luis Potosi) and Hueyapan (Morellos) and Iâ€™ve also worked on documenting reciprocal constructions and spatial language in Acazulco OtomÃ­ (The state of Mexico).</p>

<p>I am interested in how technology can effectively be combined with traditional methods of language documentation and how making this technology easily accessible can help both experts and non-experts with efforts of language documentation. Always happy to receive suggestions on new technology that can be utilised!</p>

<h3 id="cognitive-science">Cognitive science</h3>

<p>Experimental design and using psycholinguistics methods both in the field and in the lab is integral to my research and my interests in cognitive science. Iâ€™ve used and been involved in developing a range of psycholinguistic methods designed to be used in the field, with a focus on methods targeting motion descriptions and spatial gestures. For example my acting skills can be seen on full display in the brilliant <a href="https://osf.io/4bpxd/">Associated Motion Video Stimuli</a> designed by Ditte Boeg Thomsen and Mads Nielsen.</p>

<p>For my <a href="link">Masterâ€™s thesis</a> I designed a mouse tracking study investigating the processing of reflexive pronouns in Danish as part of my masterâ€™s thesis. I also participate in the <a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/school/humanities-creative-industries-social-sciences/groups/clshs/research/lab-for-applied-language-science">Lab of Applied Language Science</a> at the University of Newcastle developing interactive eye-tracking tasks.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-typology">Semantic typology</h3>

<p>Underlying my research is an interest in semantic typology, or the study of how meaning is structured across the worlds languages. This is relevant to my work on <a href="link">reciprocal constructions</a> (Danish article, English in prep.), spatial frames of reference (in Nahuatl and as part of my PhD), and Iâ€™ve written a <a href="link">pioneering paper</a> (in Danish) on how the domain of baked goods is structured differently across a handful of European languages.</p>
