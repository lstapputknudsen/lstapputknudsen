# About me

I'm a linguist from Denmark and a PhD Candidate at the University of Newcastle in Australia. I currently research spatial language, culture, and cognition in Wik-Mungkan as part of the [OzSpace project](https://www.ozspace.org). I completed my masterâ€™s degree at the University of Copenhagen in Functional and Cognitive Linguistics.

My primary research interests are within the fields of anthropological linguistics, cognitive science, and semantic typology.
