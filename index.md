# About me

I'm a linguist from Denmark and a PhD candidate at the University of Newcastle in Australia. I currently research spatial language and cognition in Indigenous Australian languages. I completed my masterâ€™s degree at the University of Copenhagen in Functional and Cognitive Linguistics.

My research interests cover a range of related fields such as anthropological linguistics, cognitive science, and semantic typology.
