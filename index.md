# About me

I am a linguistics PhD student at the University of Newcastle in Australia. I hold a Master's degree from the University of Copenhagen in Functional and Cognitive Linguistics.

I currently research spatial language in indigenous Australian languages as part of the OzSpace project. My research interests include: language documentation; psycholinguistic methods; semantic typology; and the relationship between environment, culture, cognition and language.
